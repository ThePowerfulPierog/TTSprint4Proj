# TTSprint4Proj

This project is a proof of concept to practice builing interactive web applications with Streamlit and Render.

The project performs basic exploratory data analysis on a dataset of car sale advertisements using our Plotly Express, Pandas, and Streamlit libraries.  Specifically, we'll practice creating historgrams, scatterplots, and features such as checkboxes in our app to make data easier to digest for our peers.

To launch this program on your local machine, you will likely need to drag the `config.toml` file out of the `.streamlit` folder.  This file is only needed when deploying through Render and may interfere with local deployment.
